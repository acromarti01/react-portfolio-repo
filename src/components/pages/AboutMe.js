                        I am a student at Rice University Coding Boot Camp currently living in Houston, Texas. I graduated from
                        Michigan
                        State University with a bachelorâ€™s degree in computer science engineering. Some projects I have worked
                        on include
                        building a database and a gas mileage calculator for the Houston Health Department.

                        My fascination for computers
                        started around late middle school. Before I knew it, I would spend hours just surfing many websites
                        looking at their
                        creative styling and wondering how developers were able to create something so captivating. Some things
                        I like to do
                        in my free time is running, watching sports and anime, and playing video games.
